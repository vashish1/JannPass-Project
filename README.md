## Our Solution-

    •	Our Solution is both web and app based.

    •	E-pass will be issued in three time slots for each day during lockdown.
    •	For each time slot limited passes, eg:100, will be available.
    •	Once pass is issued, same person cannot issue another for 1week.
    •	One person allowed per pass and pass is issued with Aadhaar number.
